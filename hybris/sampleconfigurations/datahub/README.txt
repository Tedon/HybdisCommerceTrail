# Information about the provided sample configuration 
#

Please find ready to use pre-configured examples of the hybris Commerce Suite and the hybris Data Hub to be used with the SAP integration content.

You'll find 2 files in this directory:
1) context.xml:		to use hybris Data Hub without SAP specific extensions
2) context_sap.xml:	to use hybris Data Hub with SAP specific extensions

In any case one of those files needs to be copied into ${HYBRIS_BIN_DIR}/ext-integration/datahub to side-by-side deploy the hybris Data Hub into the same Tomcat with 
the hybris Commerce Suite.
